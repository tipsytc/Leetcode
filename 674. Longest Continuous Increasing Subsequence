# [674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence/)

## Problem


Given an unsorted array of integers  `nums`, return  _the length of the longest  **continuous increasing subsequence**  (i.e. subarray)_. The subsequence must be  **strictly**  increasing.

A  **continuous increasing subsequence**  is defined by two indices  `l`  and  `r`  (`l < r`) such that it is  `[nums[l], nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1], nums[r]]`  and for each  `l <= i < r`,  `nums[i] < nums[i + 1]`.
