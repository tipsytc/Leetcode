# [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

## Problem

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

#### Example 1:

```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

#### Example 2:

```
Given nums = [3,2,4], target = 6

Because nums[1] + nums[2] = 2 + 4 = 6,
return [1, 2].
```

## Solution:
